Sprint 3

Main tasks we have done since sprint 2:

-Updated schema.py
Since we were adding CRUD operations, we needed to add schemas for creating, returning, and updating client information.

-Updated router.py
The starter code in this file was only handling the predictions endpoint. We added complete CRUD operations including adding new clients, getting all clients or a specific client, modifying client information, and removing clients.

-Added service.py
We donâ€™t want router.py to be handling HTTP requests and business logic at the same time, so we decided to add a service layer in the service folder so that router.py handles HTTP requests and this service layer manages the business logic.

-Updated main.py
We added API metadata for information to be more complete.
