Sprint 2:

After our group discussion, we decided to use SQLite for its simplicity and ease of use to create our database. It doesn't require installation, since it's just a file that is integrated directly into Python, making it an ideal choice for smaller applications like our project.

Some of the main tasks we have done:
1.Set up a virtual environment for our API development and installed the necessary packages from requirments.txt.
2.Created database.py:
Established the database connection.
Provided a base class for the models.
3.Created models.py:
Designed the schema for the Client table.
Defined fields with appropriate data types.
4.Updated main.py:
Ensured all database tables can be created when the app starts.
