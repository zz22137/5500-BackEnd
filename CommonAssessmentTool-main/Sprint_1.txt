Conducted research on APIs: learned about the concept of API and API endpoints, examined the differences between FastAPI and traditional REST APIs
Explored API CRUD Functionality: how to create, read, update, and delete client information
Familiarized ourselves with error handling: researched into best practices for handling common API errors with a focus on how to return appropriate HTTP status codes
